# TESS Planet Discovery Pro

An advanced web application for discovering exoplanets using real data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This project implements professional-grade algorithms for transit detection, statistical validation, and habitability assessment.

## Features

- **Real TESS Data Processing**: Downloads and processes actual TESS observations
- **Advanced Detection Algorithms**: 
  - Box Least Squares (BLS)
  - Transit Least Squares (TLS)
- **Statistical Validation**: Bootstrap analysis for false alarm probability
- **Multi-Planet System Analysis**: Detects multiple planets in a system
- **Habitability Assessment**: Evaluates potential for life with Earth Similarity Index
- **Research Study**: Compares detection methods using known exoplanet systems
- **Interactive Chatbot**: ExoBot answers questions about exoplanets
- **Comparison with Known Planets**: Validates detections against NASA's Exoplanet Archive
